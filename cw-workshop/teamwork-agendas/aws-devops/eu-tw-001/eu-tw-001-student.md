<strong>A.</strong> Share the AWS Management console credentials with the person at home over the phone, so they can execute on the cloud solutions architect behalf<br>
<strong>B.</strong> Use third-party remote desktop software to access the Windows-based machine at home from the non-GUI workstations and administer the necessary tasks<br>
<strong>C.</strong> Use Secure Shell (SSH) to securely connect to the Windows-based machine from one of the non-GUI Linux-based machines then log onto the AWS Management console<br>
<strong>D.</strong> Install and run AWS CLI on one of the non-GUI Linux-based machines, in a shell environment such as bash, the cloud solutions architect can access ALL services just as they could from a Windows-based machine.

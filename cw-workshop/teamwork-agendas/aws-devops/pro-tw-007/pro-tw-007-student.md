**1. A company is planning to build a 2-tier architecture with a web server and a database server with separate environments for development and testing.  The architecture will be hosted on EC2 Instances accordingly, and the database server would require more than 10,000 IOPS per volume.  Which of the following EBS volumes are optimum for the underlying EC2 Instances? (Select Two)**

<strong>A.</strong> General Purpose SSD for the web server <br>
<strong>B.</strong> Provisioned IOPS for the web server
<br>
<strong>C.</strong> General Purpose SSD for the database server <br> 
<strong>D.</strong>  Provisioned IOPS for the database server <br>



<br>

**2. A website is hosted on two EC2 instances that sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The response time of the website has been slowed down dramatically, and customers are placing fewer orders due to the wait time. Troubleshooting showed that one of the EC2 instances has failed and only one instance is running now. What is the best course of action to prevent this from happening in the future?**

<strong>A.</strong> Change the instance size to the maximum available to compensate for the failure <br>
<strong>B.</strong> Use CloudWatch to monitor the VPC Flow Logs for the VPC, where the instances are deployed in  <br>
<strong>C.</strong> Configure the ELB to perform health checks on the EC2 instances and implement auto-scaling <br> 
<strong>D.</strong> Replicate the existing configuration in several regions for failover
<br>


<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

**3. You are hosting a web server on an EC2 Instance. With the number of requests consuming a large part of the CPU, the response performance for the application is getting degraded. Which of the following would help to alleviate the problem and provide a better response time?**

<strong>A.</strong> Place the EC2 Instance behind a Classic Load Balancer. <br>
<strong>B.</strong> Place the EC2 Instance behind an Application Load Balancer. <br>
<strong>C.</strong> Place the EC2 Instance in an Auto Scaling Group with the max size as 1. <br>
<strong>D.</strong> Place a CloudFront distribution in front of the EC2 Instance. <br>


<br>

**4. You have an application developed in .NET. This applications works with the S3 buckets in a particular region. The application is hosted on an EC2 Instance.**

**Which of the following should ideally be used to ensure that the EC2 Instance has the appropriate access to the S3 buckets?**

<strong>A.</strong> AWS Users <br>
<strong>B.</strong> AWS Groups <br>
<strong>C.</strong> AWS IAM Roles<br> 
<strong>D.</strong> AWS IAM Policies


<br>

**5. A company is hosting a MySQL database in AWS using the AWS RDS service. To offload the reads, a Read Replica has been created and reports are run off the Read Replica database. But at certain times, the reports show stale data. What could be the possible reason behind this?**


<strong>A.</strong> The Read Replica has not been created properly. <br>
<strong>B.</strong> The backup of the original database has not been set properly. <br>
<strong>C.</strong>  This is due to the replication lag. <br> 
<strong>D.</strong> The Multi-AZ feature is not enabled.

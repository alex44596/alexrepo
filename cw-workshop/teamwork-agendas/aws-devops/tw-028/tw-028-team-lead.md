**1. What is Docker Swarm and which network driver should be used with it?**


**Answer:**

*Docker Swarm is an open-source container orchestration tool that is integrated with the Docker engine and CLI. If you want to use Docker Swarm, you should use the overlay network driver. Using an overlay network enables the Swarm service by connecting multiple docker host daemons together.*



<br>

**2. You have a set of Docker images that you use for building containers. You want to start using the Elastic Container Service and utilize the Docker images. You need a place to store these Docker images. What would you use for this purpose?**

<strong>A.</strong> Use AWS DynamoDB to store the Docker images.<br>
<strong>B.</strong> Use AWS RDS to store the Docker images. <br>
<strong>C.</strong> Use EC2 Instances with EBS Volumes to store the Docker images. <br> 
<strong>D.</strong> Use the ECR Service to store the Docker images.
<br>



**Answer:** *D*

*Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), simplifying your development to production workflow.*

*For more information on the Elastic Container Service, please visit the* [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/?nc2=h_m1)




<br>

**3. Why should you use Amazon ECR?**

**Answer:** 

*Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate and scale the infrastructure required to power your container registry. Amazon ECR uses Amazon S3 for storage to make your container images highly available and accessible, allowing you to reliably deploy new containers for your applications. Amazon ECR transfers your container images over HTTPS and automatically encrypts your images at rest. You can configure policies to manage permissions for each repository and restrict access to IAM users, roles, or other AWS accounts. Amazon ECR integrates with Amazon ECS and the Docker CLI, allowing you to simplify your development and production workflows. You can easily push your container images to Amazon ECR using the Docker CLI from your development machine, and Amazon ECS can pull them directly for production deployments.*


<br>

**4. What are the various ways in which build can be scheduled in Jenkins?**

**Answer:** 

You can schedule a build in Jenkins in the following ways:

- By source code management commits
- After completion of other builds
- Can be scheduled to run at a specified time (crons)
- Manual Build Requests



<br>

**5. How can Jenkins fit into a cloud computing environment?**


**Answer:**

*Cloud computing services use the CI/CD model so that they can push their work to the customers and constantly receive feedback. Jenkins is used to automating the CI/CD pipelines. For example, a lot of Jenkins plugins are available for many of the AWS services like Amazon EC2 and ECS.*  <br>

Ask the questions below:

- What went well? 
- What could be improved? 
- What will we commit to do better in the next week?

We assume that each group has two sub teams. If this is possible one of the sub teams will present the coding challenge of last week. The other sub team will present the solution to the previous problem of the week. If there is only one sub team then, the sub team will present both of the solutions.

Ask the questions below:

- What went well? 
- What could be improved? 
- What will we commit to do better in the next week?

We assume that each group has two sub teams. If this is possible one of the sub teams will present the coding challenge of last week. The other sub team will present the solution to the previous problem of the week. If there is only one sub team then, the sub team will present both of the solutions.

**Case study should be explained to the students during the weekly meeting and has to be completed in one week by the students. Students should work in small teams to complete the case study.**

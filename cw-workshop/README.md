## Rules & Policy

- This repo is writable for Instructors and Mentors, read only for guests.

- Every material within this repo is to be prepared with complete solution.

- Materials are meant to be reference for teachers to deliver the lessons in class.

- Instructors and Mentors can develop contents within the branches created for them for specific tasks. Creating a project, a coding challenge, a teamwork paper or a hands-on training on one topic is to be considered as specific task.

- Branches are to named after the related main areas or topics, followed by training code (`ho for hands-on`, `pr for project`, `cc for coding challenge`, `tw for teamwork agenda `), and name/id of the training. For example; branch name for `project 001` in AWS would be `aws/pr-001`, branch name for hands-on training named `docker-01` in DevOps would be `devops/ho-docker-01`, branch name for a `coding challenge 001` in Python would be `python/cc-001`, branch name for a `teamwork agenda 001` in AWS & DevOps would be `aws-devops/tw-001` etc.    

- When the content of coding challenges, projects or hands-on training is ready, Content Creators can create `pull request` for merging to development(`dev`) branch. And upon merging the branch to `dev` branch, the branch the specific task is to be deleted.

- When developing contents for project, instructors and mentors are advised to use [Project Readme Template](./projects-readme-template.md) as guideline, for complete example take a look at [Project-001](./aws/projects/001-roman-numerals-converter/README.md).

- When developing contents for hands-on training, instructors and mentors are advised to use [Hands-on Training Template](./hands-on-training-template.md) as guideline, for complete example take a look at [Hands-on Flask-01](./python/hands-on/flask-01-hello-world-app-on-ec2-linux2/README.md).

- When preparing a coding challenge, instructors and mentors are advised to use [Coding Challenge Template](./coding-challenge-template.md) as guideline, for complete example take a look at [Coding Challenge - 001](./python/coding-challenges/cc-001-convert-to-roman-numerals/README.md).

- When preparing a teamwork agenda, instructors and mentors are advised to use [Teamwork Agenda Template](./teamwork-agenda-template.md) as guideline, for complete example of team-lead version, take a look at [Teamwork Agenda - 001 : Team-lead Version](./teamwork-agendas/aws-devops/tw-001-team-lead.md)

- Once the content is done, deliverable will be merged to master branch by the repo owner and the student version of deliverable (without solution) will be transferred to the `clarusway-workshop` student repo.
